# Frontend Engineering Assessment (30-60 minutes total)

## Hints
<p style="color:orange; font-size: 20px;">Start simple and build up complexity gradually
Draw diagrams as you progress through each stage
Focus on explaining key decisions at each stage
Consider trade-offs between different approaches</p>

## Tips for Successful Completion:

*Manage your time:*

- Stage 1: 5-10 minutes
- Stage 2: 7-10 minutes
- Stage 3: 7-10 minutes (optional)
- Stage 4: 8-10 minutes (optional)
- Final Review: 2-5 minutes

### For each stage:
1. First sketch the diagram
2. Then write brief explanations
3. Move to next stage only when current stage is clear

### Common pitfalls to avoid:

- ***Don't over-complicate early stages***
- ***Don't skip error handling***
- ***Don't forget to explain key decisions***
