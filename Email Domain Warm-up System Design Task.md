# Email Domain Warm-up System Design Task
Duration: 30 minutes

## Context
Your company is launching a new email marketing service and needs to establish a good sending reputation for a new email domain. You have a user base of 100,000 users who need to receive regular communications, but sending high volumes immediately would likely result in the domain being blocked or emails going to spam.

## Business Requirements
- Start with very low sending volumes and gradually increase over time
- Monitor bounce rates, spam reports, and delivery success
- Achieve a final state of being able to send to all 100,000 users
- Ensure high deliverability rates (>95%)
- Support both transactional and marketing emails
- Comply with email sending best practices

## Technical Constraints
- Must handle varying feedback from different email providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.)
- Must be able to pause or rollback sending volume if issues are detected
- System should be scalable for future growth beyond 100,000 users
- Must maintain sending reputation across multiple IP addresses

## Task
Create a system design diagram using draw.io that illustrates:

1. Components needed for:
   - Email queue management
   - Sending rate control
   - Feedback processing
   - Analytics and monitoring
   - Volume adjustment system

2. How the system would:
   - Schedule emails
   - Process provider feedback
   - Adjust sending volumes
   - Handle failures
   - Scale up sending capacity

3. Include in your diagram:
   - System components
   - Data flows
   - Integration points
   - Monitoring points
   - Scaling mechanisms

## Expected Deliverables
1. High-level system architecture diagram
2. Brief explanations of key components
3. Description of:
   - Warm-up strategy
   - Monitoring approach
   - Scaling strategy
   - Failure handling

## Evaluation Criteria
1. Scalability of the solution
2. Handling of provider feedback
3. Monitoring and alerting strategy
4. Compliance with email best practices
5. Clarity of the design

## Bonus Points For
- Consideration of different email types (marketing vs. transactional)
- Geographic distribution strategy
- IP warm-up strategy alongside domain warm-up
- Automation of rate adjustments
- A/B testing capabilities

## Example Considerations
- How to select initial users for warm-up
- How to handle different email provider requirements
- How to measure and maintain sender reputation
- How to handle sudden spikes in bounce rates
- How to manage IP rotation

## Notes
- Assume standard email provider feedback mechanisms (bounce, spam reports, etc.)
- Consider both immediate and delayed feedback
- Think about how to maintain sending rhythm during the warm-up period
